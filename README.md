# FlowImageAnalysis
Variable_Threshold is a plugin for FIJI (ImageJ) that analyzes a stack of images of particles created by flow imaging equipment.  It finds the boundaries of the particles using a threshold based on particle brightness, then displays the particles and outputs a spreadsheet of particle properties.
